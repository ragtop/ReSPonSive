ReSPonSive is a fully responsive, highly customizable, RSPS website template.  It is not like other RSPS website templates in that you just download it and everyone else who downloads it has the same exact site.  That isn't the goal.  The goal of this project is to give you all the tools you need to make your RSPS website (or any kind of website really) great.  The entire project relies on HTML5, Javascript, and [SASS](http://sass-lang.com).  

Commonly, people don't have [SASS](http://sass-lang.com).  You can install [SASS](http://sass-lang.com) and read more about it's superpowers at their website: [http://sass-lang.com](http://sass-lang.com) 

####How does ReSPonSive accomplish this?
It accomplishes total control of your website template by allowing you to easily change theme colors, add plugins, and more stylesheets to your site.

####What kind of plugins are there?
This is an open-source project and anyone is who is willing to contribute, can contribute. This means that there can be an infinite amount of plugins that can be at the ready for you.  Plugins and How-to set each plugin/partial up will be included within the Wiki pages.
